Breaches from government or private agencies

Complaints can be made to the Office of Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) when you suspect that a breach has been made by government or private companies covered by the privacy act.

If you notice a breach, you must first attempt to make contact with the company and resolve the issue with them. If after 30 days you do not receive a satisfactory response, then a complaint may be made to the OAIC.
